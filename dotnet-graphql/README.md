GraphQL with docker

## System Requirements

[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/)


## To launch the applications

To start, run this command to build and fire up the docker containers (need the --build for the first time):

```
docker-compose up --build
```

This will launch 2 applications: front-end in port 3000; back-end (GraphQL) in port 3001
